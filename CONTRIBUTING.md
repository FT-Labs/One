## Contribution Tools

### Pre-commit
A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language `pre-commit` hooks.
Pre-commit can be [installed](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) with
`pip`, `curl`, `brew` or `conda`.

You need to first install `pre-commit` and then install the `pre-commit` hooks
with `pre-commit install`. Now `pre-commit` will run automatically on git
commit!

If you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) at your system, so you can
easily install pre-commit via `pip install pre-commit`.

It's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all the files when
adding new hooks (usually `pre-commit` will only run on the changed files
during git hooks). Use `pre-commit run --all-files` to check all files.

To run a single hook use `pre-commit run --all-files <hook_id>`

To update use `pre-commit autoupdate`
